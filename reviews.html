<h2>What Our Furry Friends Are Saying</h2>
	<p> 
	"I loved my time at Doggie Adentures. My mom and dad went out of town so Michelle at Doggie Adventures came and had a sleepover with me. We went on lots of walks, played sooo much fetch, and she even taught me a few tricks. When my parents came home they were so impressed that they've given me lots and lots of treats. I hope Michelle comes and stays again soon! Until then, I'll be resting from my fun weekend" - Chopper the Boxer

"I had so much fun with Jessica from Doggie Adventures. My mom hired her to come visit us during the day while she is at work. We always do the coolest things. Here is a picture of me playing in the sprinkler!" -Roxy
