<h3>Our Furry Friend, Dixie</h3>
	<p>Dixie is a 7 year old chocolate lab that is the energy of our household. I believe that she is mixed with a german shorthair pointer, but we have never confirmed that. Dixie's perfect day would consist of playing fetch in the lake until she physically can't anymore, having an ice cream pup cup to cool off, and then snuggling up for a nap. She also enjoys camping, hunting, and pretty much anything outdoors.
